## Abstract

The Hoon pretty printer (i.e. [standard library 5c][stdlib-5c]) is broadly
responsible for transforming `$type` and `$vase` nouns into `$tank`
equivalents, generally for the purpose of rendering these nouns in a
human-legible format. While its current implementation admirably performs this
task for nearly all simple and semi-complex nouns, it suffers from performance
and legibility problems for common nontrivial inputs such as meta-`$vase`
nouns, `%lull` types, and noun comparisons (e.g. via `+dext:nest:ut`).
Additionally, the pretty printer's limited set of customization options forces
all output to exist at one of two levels of abstraction: extremely verbose (the
default) or extremely terse (for types annotated with `$+`). This proposal
contains an array of suggestions to address these deficiencies in an iterative
and user-oriented manner.

## Motivation

There are numerous simple pretty printer invocations that render a ship
unusable or produce largely illegible results. The following is a short list of
common representative examples:

1. `!>(*)`, `+<..`: Processes for several minutes before ultimately crashing the
   ship with a `recover: dig: meme` error.
2. `->:!>(*noun)`: Fails to print any output, exiting with a `dojo: failed to
   process input` error.
3. `^-((unit dome:clay) *dome:clay)`: Produces nearly 900 lines of output for a
   difference spanning a single line.

The lack of per-type printing customization also makes it difficult to tune
the pretty printer's level of detail to the user's operative level of
abstraction. This presents problems most commonly for developers at both ends
of the abstraction range (i.e. core and app developers), who encounter troubles
with outputs for nouns like:

1. `-:!>(*peer-state:ames)`: Prints `#t/#peer-state`, which is unhelpful for a
   core developer attempting to debug/inspect this structure at a nontrivial
   level of detail.
2. `^-((tree [@t @]) (malt ~[[';' 1] [':' 2] ['!' 3]]))`: Prints the tree using
   set-like `{…}` syntax, which makes it difficult for a core developer that
   wants to see the node ordering of the underlying tree structure.
3. `mint:ut`: Prints the `+mint` arm using the pretty printer's `<X.abc …>`
   summary syntax, which is difficult to parse for an app developer trying to
   determine the function's signature (doccords helps with this somewhat,
   but cannot easily print door arms).

## Specification

> Joe (`~master-morzod`) had some interesting ideas for how to rewrite the pretty
> printer in a way that might be easier—and maybe even more principled—involving
> using the `%hint` type for types, treating that like a mark, and then
> allowing you to write a function that describes how data of that mark could be
> pretty printed. Then, you could write a pretty printer where the logic of the
> printer itself doesn't know anything about those (marks) and is a very dumb
> genric—and that could be really nice.

- In a similar vein to [`+easy-print`][stdlib-ep], develop a parallel version
  of the [`+us` door][stdlib-5c] that uses a modified `$type` structure to
  enable generic support of custom printing functions. This new door will
  assume the temporary name `+ur`.
  - Develop a parallel stack of `$type`-related structures to enable per-`$type`
    mark-like annotations:
    - `$noat`: The `$note` structure with an extra case for `%mark` annotations:
      ```hoon
      +$  noat                                           ::  type annotation
                $%  [%help p=help]                       ::  documentation
                    [%know p=stud]                       ::  global standard
                    [%made p=term q=(unit (list wing))]  ::  structure
                    [%mark p=term]                       ::  mark annotation
                ==                                       ::
      ```
    - `$taip`: The `$type` structure with `$noat` used for the `%hint` case:
      ```hoon
      +$  taip  $~  %noun                                ::
                $@  $?  %noun                            ::  any nouns
                        %void                            ::  no noun
                    ==                                   ::
                $%  [%atom p=term q=(unit @)]            ::  atom / constant
                    [%cell p=taip q=taip]                ::  ordered pair
                    [%core p=taip q=coil]                ::  object
                    [%face p=$@(term tune) q=taip]       ::  namespace
                    [%fork p=(set taip)]                 ::  union
                    [%hint p=noat q=taip]                ::  annotation
                    [%hold p=taip q=hoon]                ::  lazy evaluation
                ==                                       ::
      ```
    - `$vaze`: The `$vase` structure substituting `$taip` for `$type`:
      ```hoon
      +$  vase  [p=taip q=*]                             ::  type-value pair
      ```
  - Develop a temporary set of translation functions from the `$type` stack
    to the `$taip` stack:
    - `$taipify`: A function `$-(type taip)` that trivially transforms `$type`s
      into equivalent `$taip`s (with minor massaging for `%hint` cases).
    - `$vazify`: A function `$-(vase vaze)` that trivially transforms `$vase`s
      into equivalent `$vaze`s (using `$taipify`).
    - `$taiwrap`: A function `$-([type term] taip)` that wraps a `$type` with
      an outer `[%hint p=[%mark term] q=type]`.
  - Create the `+ur` door with `+us` as a template and the following changes:
    - Introduce the concept of a pretty printer core as a core with a base
      processing arm `+$` and one or more per-mark arms:
      ```hoon
      |%
      ++  $     |=(i=(each taip vaze) `tank`…)
      ++  mark  |=(i=(each taip vaze) `tank`…)
      ::  ++  {face|tree|wall|…}
      ::  …
      ```
    - Augment the door sample with a pretty printer core `pin` (stored as a
      `$vaze`) with the default content matching the existing `$cape:us`
      pretty printer special cases:
      ```hoon
      |_  [sur=taip pin=vaze]
      ```
    - Add a function `+dent:ur` with signature `$-(vaze vaze)` that produces
      a version of the door pretty printer `pin` with arms overwritten by the
      contents of the pretty printer core sample `$vaze`.
    - Add a (temporary?) function `+doxx:ur` with signature `$-(type taip)`
      that adds `%mark` annotations to ordinary `$type`s using the heuristics
      previously present in `+dole:ur`.
- Analogous to the above, create a parallel door to `+ut` nominally named `+uq`
  that contains a modified nesting algorithm in `+dext:nest:uq` that reports
  `$type` errors as diffs instead of a sequence of comparative dumps. This could
  be approached a couple of different ways:
  - *Text Diff*: Leverage the [text diffing
    algorithm](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/develop/pkg/arvo/sys/zuse.hoon#L3966)
    currently in `zuse` to present a line-based diff.
  - *Tree Diff*: Leverage the [noun diffing
  algorithm](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/6681) implemented by
  `~racfer-hattes` (i.e. @ilyakooo0) in order to present a tree-based diff.
- Segregate these changes to a standalone `/lib/uip119/hoon` file, which can be
  integrated into `/sys/hoon/hoon` as part of a future `hoon` Kelvin decrement.

## Rationale

- Using an embedded and customizable pretty printer core in `+us` has two major
  advantages:
  - The existing "special case" print functions (e.g. for `$tree`s, `$face`s,
    etc.) can be integrated into a unified and holistic architecture.
  - Each `$type`-based print function can be fine tuned to the abstraction
    layer of the developer—core developers can use verbose, near-noun
    representations and app developers can use terse, near-`$+`/`%know`
    presentations.
- Presenting type nesting failures as diffs reduces output noise, drastically
  reducing deciphering time and improving developer experience.

## Backwards Compatibility

- Development can safely be performed using parallel arms and structures,
  enabling extensive vetting/testing prior to integration.
- Using the new stack of `$type`-related structures will break backward
  compatibility and require and `hoon` Kelvin decrement.
- Replacing `+us` and `+ut` with their the parallel counterparts `+ur` and
  `+uq` will break backward compatibility with all code dependent on pretty
  printer outputs.
